        /*  The Map class contains properties and methods for storing, managing, and overlaying layers common to both 2D and 3D viewing. Layers can be added 
        and removed from the map, but are rendered via a MapView (for viewing data in 2D) or a SceneView (for viewing data in 3D). 
        Thus a map instance is a simple container that holds the layers, while the View is the means of displaying and interacting with a map's layers and basemap.*/
